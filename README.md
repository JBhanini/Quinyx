# Quinyx
A simple technical test for my job application at Quinyx.

Part 1 (main.py): Developing a web server that chares 10 Chuck Norris jokes from: http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/

I've decided to use fast api to help with developing the server.
I've embedded the necessary commands to start the server within the python script.
The rest api has two endpoints:
An endpoint to check if the api is indeed online and functioning (health)
An endpoint to get the jokes

Part 2 (sales.py): Processing and grouping data from an xlsx file and saving the output as a csv file.

I've decided to use pandas for this task as i find it is one of the best tools for working with data.
Within a few lines of codes, and thanks to panda's built-in data processing functions, I was able to process, group, and export the data as required to a csv file.

Thank you!
